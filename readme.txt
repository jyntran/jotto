JOTTO README

This program allows the player to play one game of Jotto.

To guess a word, enter a word into the textfield and click the Submit button.

The program will check that it is a valid guess before calculating
the exact and partial totals. This includes word length, whether the word
is in the dictionary, and whether the word has already been guessed.

The game will end when the player correctly guesses the word, or the
number of guesses have reached the maximum, ie. 10 guesses.

The following are features to help the player guess the mystery word:
- The Dictionary view displays all possible words.
- The Guessed and Remaining Letters view displays all letters that
have been included in the guessed words and all letters that have not
been included respectively.
